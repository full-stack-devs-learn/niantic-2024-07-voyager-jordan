Class: Rectangle

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
         - .getArea() function returns value lower than 0

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        - getArea(), Line 40

        What test helped you find the bug?
         - getArea_negativeValues_expectedZero()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        - Added condition checking for values 0 and below

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
        - .getPerimeter() function returned incorrect perimeter

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        - Within getPerimeter method, Line 52: return height + width

        What test helped you find the bug?
         - default_getPerimeter_ReturnPerimeter_ExpectedHeightPlusWidthTimesTwo()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        - Multiplied the sum of the width and height by two to calculate for the other sides;


Class: Quiz

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
        - getPercent() function returned 0 but expected "50" based off possiblePoints = 100, score = 50;
        - the division portion resulted in zero because they were both integers when divided,
         which then resulted in the multiplication portion to result also to zero.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        - .getPercent(), Line 37

        What test helped you find the bug?
        - getPercent_returnPercentScoreOfStudent_expectPositiveValue()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        - casted double to the division to result in 0.5 and multiplied that with 100 and casted int on the result

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
        - If statement didn't correctly assign the letter grade within its percent span etc 90-100 was actually 91-100.
        - Additionally "D" case was set at 51-70 instead of 60-69.

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        - .getLetterGrade(), line: 46-50

        What test helped you find the bug?
        - getLetterGrade_returnGradeOfStudent_expectA() - Found the incorrect grade span 90-100
        - getLetterGrade_returnGradeOfStudent_expectD() - Found the incorrect D span of 51-70 instead of 60-69

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        - I added greater than and equals to operators
        - I change the lower value from 50 -> 60 to correctly change the grading system according to README

Class: GameCharacter

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
        - Energy level depleted lower than 0

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        - takeHit(), line: 32;

        What test helped you find the bug?
        - TakeHit(10) resulted in character's energy level being -10;

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        - Added a IF statement to check if the result of the takeHit() function resulted in a value lower than
        if so resulted in setting the energy level to 0;

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error: Character healed when knocked

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        - heal(), line: 41

        What test helped you find the bug?
         - heal_healCharacterIfKnocked_expectNoEnergyIncrease()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        - Added a IF statement checking characters knocked status and applying heal if not knocked

    Bug 3:

        Describe the bug/error:
        - Character heals passed max energy level

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        - heal(), line: 41

        What test helped you find the bug?
         - heal_healCharacter_expectEnergyIncrease()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        - After checking if character is not knocked checked outcome of heal and sets it to max if outcome is above max limit

    Bug 4:

        Describe the bug/error:
        - Character Initialized at energy level 0 unable to heal

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        - gameCharacter(), line: 29

        What test helped you find the bug?
         - heal_healCharacter_expectEnergyIncrease()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        - Initialized new characters starting at max energy level


Class: Printer

    Bug 1:

        Describe the bug/error:
        - Printer prints negative pages

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        - print(), line: 27

        What test helped you find the bug?
        - print_givenNegativePages_calculatesTotalPagesPrinted()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        - I added a check to see if input pages is a less than or equals
        to zero

    Bug 2:

        Describe the bug/error:
        - Printer adds negative pages

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)

        - addPaper_givenNegativePaper_doesNotAddPaperToPrinter()

        What did you do to fix the bug?
        - Added a check to see if input value of addPaper is
        greater than 0

    Bug 3:

        Describe the bug/error:
        - Printer adds more than max toner

        Where was the bug? (function, line number)
        - replaceToner(), line: 56
